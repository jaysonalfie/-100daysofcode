### March 13th 2024 - Day 3 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Was able to learn how high order array methods work to manipulate data and also the object oriented programming of JS by looking at how constructors work. I was also able to learn about conditional statements and about how ternary operators can be used to accomplish the same.

**Thought's**:The fundamentals are proving to be easy to grasp and require more practice and research especially into ES6 JS. Need to do more
