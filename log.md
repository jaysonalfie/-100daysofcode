# 100DaysOfCode Log 

### March 11th 2024 - Day 1 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Managed to go through JS basics as a reminder

**Thought's**:The basics are imprortant nad form a good foundation for advanced problems

### March 12th 2024 - Day 2 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Delved a bit deeper into JS basic like tackling arrays, object literals, JSON,  and template literals and loops

**Thought's**:The additional basic information are proving to be key escpecially with the ES6 js.

### March 13th 2024 - Day 3 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Was able to learn how high order array methods work to manipulate data and also the object oriented programming of JS by looking at how constructors work. I was also able to learn about conditional statements and about how ternary operators can be used to accomplish the same.

**Thought's**:The fundamentals are proving to be easy to grasp and require more practice and research especially into ES6 JS. Need to do more

### March 14th 2024 - Day 4 of 100

**Today's Progress**:Was able to learn about the DOM and explore it and see how to manipulate the objects found in the DOM and also learnt about Events and how they are used. Learnt also about multiple and single selectors that are used in JS

**Thought's**:JS is fun and I really want to see where it goes. Very interesting things it can do if you ask me

### March 15th 2024 - Day 5 of 100

**Today's Progress**:Began learning React, a JS framework.Was able to learn how components work, how JSX is used and the differences between JSX and HTML. Was also able to know how to render an app so that it is visible on the web browser.

**Thought's**:React is an interesting framework in how it works and I'm looking foward to see what it unfolds

### March 18th 2024 - Day 6 of 100

**Today's Progress**:Managed to start learning React components wiith the first property being components testing with the use of a few examples. Also got to see a library of CSS know as Semantic and how it can be used.

**Thought's**:Who knew components could be nested, a great way to enhance reusability.

### March 19th 2024 - Day 7 of 100

**Today's Progress**:Learnt more about component resuability and how the prop system aids in enabling component configuration. The prop system also brings the object oriented paradigm into React , topics such as inheritance.

**Thought's**:Components truly aid in mimimizing code and ensuring the code is clean.

### March 25th 2024 - Day 8 of 100

**Today's Progress**:First revised all I had learnt about functional components and went ahead to begin studying class based components. Also learnt how the geolocation API works and how it returns the latitude showing the location. Also began study on states and how they are important for complicated processes.

**Thought's**:Things are getting interesting real fast and I will keep up.

### March 26th 2024 - Day 9 of 100

**Today's Progress**:First revised all I had learnt about class- based components then went further to learn how the state system works and how it helps to update content in the application. eg enabling one to know a user's location using the geolocation API. Also began looking at the lifecycle method of which constructor is one of them.

**Thought's**:The basics really get you as you try to build up on the foundation of what you want to do.

### March 27th 2024 - Day 10 of 100

**Today's Progress**:Went a bit further into learning the lifecycle methods and how they are used. Also learnt about ternary operations that are if-else statements used with JS. Also learnt about deconstructive assignment in which an object is created and keys from it can be accessed.

**Thought's**:Deconstructive assignment is interesting that spaces can cause a component to not render. Keeps getting interesting.
