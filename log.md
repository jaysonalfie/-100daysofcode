### March 13th 2024 - Day 3 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Was able to learn how high order array methods work to manipulate data and also the object oriented programming of JS by looking at how constructors work. I was also able to learn about conditional statements and about how ternary operators can be used to accomplish the same.

**Thought's**:The fundamentals are proving to be easy to grasp and require more practice and research especially into ES6 JS. Need to do more

### March 18th 2024 - Day 6 of 100

### March 26th 2024 - Day 9 of 100

**Today's Progress**:First revised all I had learnt about class- based components then went further to learn how the state system works and how it helps to update content in the application. eg enabling one to know a user's location using the geolocation API. Also began looking at the lifecycle method of which constructor is one of them.

**Thought's**:The basics really get you as you try to build up on the foundation of what you want to do.
